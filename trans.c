/* Ideas in Lab:
 * Givens:
 *  - E = 1 (line per set)
 *  - s = 5 (2^5 = 32 sets)
 *  - b = 5 (2^5 = 32 bytes per line)
 *  - 32x32 matrix (1024 elements, 1024*4 = 4096 bytes)
 *  ^ different for 64x64 and 67x61
 * Approaches:
 *  - Transpose blocks of matrix that gets stored fully in the cache at once
 * Ex with 32x32: 32*32*4 = 4096/1024 = 4 (wraps around 4 times), 32/4 = 8 (block size that can be held in cache)
 * Ex with 64x64: 64*64*4 = 16384/1024 = 16 (wraps around 16 times), 64/4 = 16 (block size that can be held in cache)
 * Advice: Do diagonals last so you don't overwrite current cache lines (makes it more optimized)
